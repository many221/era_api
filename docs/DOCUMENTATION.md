# Election Results API Documentation

## System Architecture
The Election Results API system architecture is built using a modern, layered approach that emphasizes separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. The system consists of several key layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints built with Go's net/http package
   - HTML templates for web-based result visualization
   - JSON response formatting for API consumers
   - Rate limiting and request validation

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Election result processing and aggregation
   - Data validation and normalization
   - Vote calculation and percentage computation
   - Race status management
   - Real-time updates handling

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - PocketBase database integration
   - Caching mechanisms for performance
   - Data persistence and retrieval
   - Transaction management
   - Query optimization

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Multiple data source handlers
   - Parser implementations for different formats
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Data transformation pipeline
   - Source-specific adaptors

5. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Docker containerization
   - Configuration management
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Security implementations
   - Health checks and diagnostics

The system is designed to be:
- **Scalable**: Handles increasing load through horizontal scaling
- **Resilient**: Gracefully handles failures and data inconsistencies
- **Maintainable**: Well-organized code structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Secure**: Implements authentication, authorization, and data validation
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
